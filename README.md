# bootctf #

CTF playground of CCoWMU.

## Overview ##

Every cclub member can both develop and complete CTF challenges at BootCTF.

This will make it easier to introduce new members to the CTF scene and give
experienced members a place to share their knowledge.

Rather than roll out new competitions, we will simply add challenges to an
ever-growing list (think [https://projecteuler.net/][euler], but for security
competitions).
